Timewaster is a browser extension dedicated to providing productivity benefits for users by recording usage across browsing sessions. 
It is my quite simplistic endeavour into the world of web development or more specifically web extensions but has provided thorough insight and skills along the way.
This addon operates on the basics of CSS, HTML and Javascript, and displays time used on each host, with visual analysis integrated help from a library for graphing usages.
